/**
 * Exit and die are a bad idea in both development and production. In development you have no idea what
 * went wrong and in production the user receives a white page and has no idea what's going on. If you 
 * want to deny access use an ilAccessDenied Exception.
 *
 * Exception: Currently if you want to output json you most likely have to use exit() at the moment. The
 *            rule still documents the violation as it should be removed sometimes in the future.
