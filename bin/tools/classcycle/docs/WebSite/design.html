<h1>5. Hints to improve design</h1>

Some hints for removing cyclic dependencies can be extracted from
the analysis Classycle performs. As explained in
Chapter&nbsp;<a href="measures.html#3.2">3.2</a> Classycle calculates for
each class/package in the cycle its potential to fragmentize the cycle into
smaller subcycles when it is removed from the cycle. 
Classycle lists the <em>maximum fragment size</em> for each
class. The <em>best fragmenters</em> are those classes/packages in the cycle
leading to the smallest maximum fragment size. The optimum (best fragment
size = 1) is reached when a vertex is found whose removal would turn
the cycle into a complete acyclic graph.

<h2>4.1 Resolving Class Cycles</h2>

Of course removing a class does not make sense from the point of view
of a Java application because it needs this class. Fortunately, the same
effect can be obtained by replacing the vertex by two vertices in the
following way:

<center><img src="images/replaceVertex.png" width="303" height="96"></center>

All classes in the cycle who depend on A will now depend on A'. Class A'
does not depend on any class in the cycle. Of course it can depend on other 
classes outside the cycle. Class A'' depends on the same classes as the original
class A. But other classes in the cycle do not depend on A''. Again
classes outside the cycle can still depend on A''. Because the original class
A is splitted into A' and A'' there should be a dependency between both. But
only A'' depends on A' and not vice versa. Otherwise we would have still the
original cyclic dependency.
<p>
A general and widely used recipes for splitting of a class A into A' and A'' 
is the <b>introduction of an interface</b>: Here A' is an interface which is
implemented by A''. Sometimes it is possible to split A into two
independent concrete classes A' and A''. But this is a rare case.

<h2>4.2 Resolving Package Cycles</h2>

Package cycles are cured in three or four steps:
<ol>
  <li>Join the packages of a cycle into a big package containing all classes
      of the original packages.
  <li>Detect the strong components (i.e. cycles) of classes in this monster package.
  <li>Break up cycles which are large or dealing with different concerns (e.g. view classes
      and data classes). This is an optional step.
  <li>Build new packages which package the strong components.
</ol>
