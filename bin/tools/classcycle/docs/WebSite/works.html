<h1>2. How Classycle works</h1>

Classycle Analyser performs the analysis in five steps:
<ol><li><a href="#2.1">Reading the class files</a>
    <li><a href="#2.2">Creating the dependency graph of classes</a>
    <li><a href="#2.3">Creating the dependency graph of packages</a>
    <li><a href="#2.4">Detecting cycles</a>
    <li><a href="#2.5">Calculating layer indices</a>
    <li><a href="#2.6">Writing a report</a>
</ol>
The first two are also done by the Dependency Checker.

<h2><a name="2.1">2.1 Reading the Class Files</a></h2>

The analysis relies on <tt>.class</tt> files and not on <tt>.java</tt> source
files. Classycle extracts from a class file the so-called <em>constant pool</em>
which contains references to other classes.

<h2><a name="2.2">2.2 Creating the Dependency Graph of Classes</a></h2>

In order to detect class dependencies Classycle analyses the constant pool.
A constant pool contains different types of constants (for more details see
Chapter&nbsp;4 of <a href=
"http://java.sun.com/docs/books/vmspec/2nd-edition/html/VMSpecTOC.doc.html">
The Java Virtual Machine Specification</a>).
Classycle evaluates two or three of them:
<ul><li>Class constant: Refers to a UFT8 constant which contains the
        fully-qualified class name with '/' instead of '.' as package 
        name separator.
    <li>UFT8 constant: Contains an arbitray unicode-encoded string.
    <li>String constant (optionally): 
    	Refers to a UFT8 constant which contains a string constant 
    	from the Java code.
</ul>
It is not enough to evalute class constants to find all refered classes. 
For example, the constant pool of
<tt>
<pre>
class SimpleClass {
  String a;
}
</pre>
</tt>
contains only class constants for the class itself (<tt>SimpleClass</tt>) and
the superclass (<tt>java.lang.Object</tt>). But there is no class constant
for <tt>java.lang.String</tt>. Instead, there is a UTF8 constant with the value
<tt>Ljava/lang/String;</tt>. This is a so-called <em>descriptor</em> which
represents the type of a field or method. Unfortunately, there is no
special constant type for such descriptors. Classycle has to analyse each
UTF8 constant whether it is a descriptor or not. Fortunately, descriptors
are specified by a grammer (see Section&nbsp;4.3 of the Java VM Specifications).
Thus, if the UTF8 constant is a descriptor in accordance with this grammer
Classycle extracts the class names from this descriptor. Otherwise, the
UTF8 constant will be ignored. Since version 1.3 Classycle can also handle
the extended grammer for Java Generics signatures.
<p>
If the commandline option <tt>-reflectionPattern</tt> is used 
also string constants in the pool are analysed. 
A string constant (as it appears in the code of 
a Java file) is handled as a class name if the following two
conditions are fulfilled:
<ol><li>The string is a syntactically valid fully-qualified class name.
    <li>The string matches one of the specified patterns.
</ol>
If the option <tt>-reflectionPattern</tt> is used but no pattern has been 
defined only the first condition has to be fulfilled. But is always recommended
to specifiy at least one pattern. Otherwise strings like <tt>hello</tt> or
<tt>www.w3c.org</tt> are handled as class references.
<p>
Note, that this reflection option is a must if a class with the following line
of code should have a reference to <tt>java.lang.Thread</tt>:
<pre>
Class clazz = Thread.class;
</pre>

<p>
This analysis leads to a direct dependency in the following cases:
<ul><li>Superclass.
    <li>Field type.
    <li>Classes of parameters and return value of any method declared or
        invoked.
    <li>Class implementing an invoked method.
    <li>String constants if the reflection option is used and the 
    	above-mentioned conditions are fulfilled.
</ul>
Array types are not refered. Instead the element type is refered.
Note, that some references in the source code do not appear in
the class file:
<ul><li>Local variables which are never used.
    <li>Constants (i.e., <tt>static final</tt> declared fields) which can
        by resolved at compile time.
</ul>

<p>
After the analysis of the constant pools of all read class files Classycle
creates a directed graph (short: digraph): Each vertex represents an
analysed class. Vertices are connected by directed edges (usually represented
by an arrow). A directed edge will be pointed from vertex A to vertex B
if Classycle has detected that A is refering B.
The edge is called an outgoing arc for A and an incoming arc for B.
In general they will be outgoing arcs to external classes which are not
in the set of classes analysed by Classycle. These outgoing arcs will be
ignored in step 4 and 5 of the analysis.

<h2><a name="2.3">2.3 Creating the Dependency Graph of Packages</a></h2>

From the class dependency graph it is easy to get the package dependency
graph. Classycle just parses the class graph and extracts the package name
of a class from its fully qualified class name. If the class is not in a
package a package node named <tt>(default package)</tt> will be associated with
this class. Package <em>A</em> depends on package <em>B</em> if there is
at least one class in <em>A</em> which depends on at least one class in
<em>B</em>.

<h2><a name="2.4">2.4 Detecting Cycles</a></h2>

In a digraph one can walk along the arrows from vertex to vertex.
Eventually one reaches either a vertex with no outgoing arc
or an already visited vertex. In the later case one
has detected a <b>cycle</b>. Classycle detects cycles with the help of Tarjan's
algorithm for condensation of a digraph into an acyclic digraph of its
so-called <em>strong components</em>:

<center><img src="images/graphExample.png" width="401" height="205"></center>

A group of vertices has the property of being <em>strongly connected</em>
if each vertex of the group can be reached from each other vertex of the
group. A <em>strong component</em> is a strongly connected group of
vertices which looses the property of being strongly connected if a vertex
outside the group is added. A special case is a strong component containing
only one vertex (like the strong component b in the example which contains
only vertex C). Classycle reports each strong component with more than one
vertex as cycles. In the above example it would detect three cycles.
<p>
The condensation leads to a new digraph where each vertex is a strong component
of the original digraph. A directed edge goes from strong component a to b
if a directed edge goes from at least one vertex of a to at least one vertex of b.
<p>
Note, that the detection of package cycles done by
<a href="http://www.clarkware.com/software/JDepend.html">JDepend</a> can be wrong.
For example, JDepend would identify by mistake vertex C in the above-mentioned graph
as cyclic. The reason is presumably that JDepend walks through the graph until
it detects a vertex already visited. In this case it marks the starting vertex
as cyclic.

<h2><a name="2.5">2.5 Calculating Layer Indices</a></h2>

After condensation of the dependency graph to an acyclic digraph of its
strong components Classycle calculates the layer index for each strong
component. The layer index of a vertex in an acyclic digraph is the number
of edges of the longest possible walk starting at this vertex. All class/package
vertices of a cycle have the same layer index. For example, the classes
D, G, and I in the above example have all the layer index 0.
<p>
Grouping the classes of an application in layers suggests a layered
architecture of the application. In general this is not the case. The layers
introduced by the analysis of Classycle are of finer granularity and they
violates in general the rule that a layer should only know the layer
one level deeper. This rule would forbid the arrows from d to b and c
in the example.
<p>
To get a layering in this strict sense one should do a further condensation by
grouping the strong components in such a way that all edges pointing from
a vertex with layer index n to a vertex with index n-1. Unfortunately, there
is in general no unique way to do this. For example, one can condense
the above example further by forming two groups: One group contains d and
the other one c. But a and b may be both either in the d or c group or a
in the d group and b in the c group.

<h2><a name="2.6">2.6 Writing a Report</a></h2>

Finally Classycle writes the result of the analysis in a report. The most
extended report is the XML report. It lists all cycles, layers, classes and
packages. With this report it is possible to reconstruct the original 
class/package digraph. Chapter&nbsp;<a href="measures.html">3</a> explains 
the measures listed in the XML report.
